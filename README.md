## Recursion

Recursion is a technique where you break a problem into a small repeatable part and then you repeat that small part in order to solve the larger problem.

• A recursive function calls itself;
• A recursive function has two main parts:
    1. A terminating condition (base case);
    2. Recursive case;
• It is very effective when manipulating tree structures such as XML, DOM, Objects composed of other objects, etc.
