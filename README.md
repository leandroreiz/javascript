## Recursion

Recursion is a technique where you break a problem into a small repeatable part and then you repeat that small part in order to solve the larger problem.

- A recursive function calls itself
- A recursive function has two main parts, they are:

    1. Base case (terminating condition);
    2. Recursive case;

- It is very effective when manipulating tree structures such as XML, DOM, Objects composed of other objects, etc.
